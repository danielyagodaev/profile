This is my professional profile page, which I created in react with the help of @material-kit-react.

There are links to my social media profiles on the upper right corner.

I defined some basic sections which are relevant for my role: background, skills and projects.

The background text can be edited by changing the file "src/text-components/Background.js".

Everything else is editable from the main file, "src/index.js".
